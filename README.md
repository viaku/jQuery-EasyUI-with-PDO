# jeasyui-crud-using-pdo

After using the following: http://www.jeasyui.com/tutorial/app/crud.php I realized that mysql_* functions are depreciated, so I decided to code the php side files from scratch, and port it to use MySQL PDO instead.

All code is commented, and organized similar to the old MySQL version provided from the link above. You can read their website for their license or whatever. All I did was re-write it to use MySQL PDO instead, and provided better commenting. SQL Table is included. 

1. Zip Download
2. Extract to /htdocs/whatever
3. Create a database using MySQL/PhpMyAdmin
4. Import the sql
5. Navigate to http://localhost/whatever

If you have problems or issues post them here I'll see if I can help you, you should be familiar with PHP, MySQL, jQuery and have a local web server (xampp) to test on.

In regards to editing and making changes just read the code, test, and play around.
